Versioning follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org).

## [1.1.0] — 2026-03-15

### Added
- `fetch()` 10-minute TTL result cache (`_FETCH_CACHE`) controlled via
  `SICRY_CACHE_TTL` env var (default 600 s; 0 = disabled)
- `SICRY_CACHE_TTL` added to `.env.example`

### Changed
- `SEARCH_ENGINES` reduced from 18 to 12 — removed permanently-dead engines:
  Torgle, Kaizer, Anima, Tornado, TorNet, FindTor (all offline as of 2026-Q1)
- Docstring / comment counts updated: "18 engines" → "12 engines"

### Fixed
- `fetch()`: HTTPS → HTTP automatic fallback for `.onion` addresses
  (most hidden services are HTTP-only; HTTPS fetch now retries as HTTP before
  returning an error)
- `fetch()`: SOCKS-level retry — rebuilds Tor session and retries once on
  `SOCKS5`, `timed out`, or `ConnectionError` exceptions, then falls through
  to the HTTP fallback variant if both attempts fail

---

## [1.0.0] — 2026-03-14

### Added
- 18 dark web search engines (14 .onion engines + 4 clearnet Tor-routed fallbacks)
- 6 agent tools: `search`, `fetch`, `check_tor`, `renew_identity`, `ask`, `dispatch`
- Native tool schemas for Anthropic, OpenAI, and Gemini
- FastMCP server (`python3 sicry.py serve`)
- 4 LLM analysis modes: `summary`, `entity`, `threat`, `ioc`
- Full Robin OSINT pipeline baked in — no separate Robin install needed
- Tor authentication: cookie, password, hash, and unauthenticated fallback
- `__version__ = "1.0.0"`
- GitHub Actions CI (Python 3.9–3.12)
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, issue templates

### Fixed
- URL extraction now includes clearnet fallback when no `.onion` links found (fixes DuckDuckGo-Tor / Ahmia-clearnet returning 0 results)
- Ahmia `/redirect/?redirect_url=` wrapper decoded correctly
- CSS selector result containers targeted before falling back to all `<a>` tags
- `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` corrected to `claude-opus-4-5`
- Unclosed file handle in `renew_identity()` replaced with `with open()` block
